DevApp
======
You can see a preview on gh-pages http://demos74dx.github.io/DevApp/

This project uses Chrome Apps, here's how to make it work:
	Clone it
	Open chrome
	Goto chrome://flags/
	Enable Experimental Extension APIs (This add an apps bookmark to chrome)
	Restart chrome
	Tools->Extensions
	Click the Developer Mode Checkbox
	Click Load Unpacked Extension button
	Navigate to the DevApp folder and select it
	It should now be installed under your Program Files->Chrome Apps
	or you can open a new tab and hit the new apps bookmark and pull it up from there.

From here you don't need to keep Loading the unpacked extension, changes are made immediately.
